# Verifies that boundary enforcement tools reject each deliberate violation.
# A test PASSES when the tool reports an error on that fixture.
# Run from the repo root: sh .boundary-tests/run.sh
#
# The lint fixtures are linted in ONE eslint invocation and the per-fixture
# verdicts are read back out of the JSON report. Previously each fixture got its
# own `pnpm eslint` spawn, and since every spawn re-resolves the flat config and
# rebuilds the type-aware program, nearly all of the runtime was startup paid 20
# times over (~26s in CI, ~16.7s locally → ~0.4s batched). Adding a fixture now
# costs a line here, not another process.

cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."

# "<path>|<description>", one per line. A fixture missing from the eslint report
# (renamed, deleted, or silently ignored by config) FAILS — absence is not a pass.
