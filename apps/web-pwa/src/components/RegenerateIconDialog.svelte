  // editor (shared across canon items and product forms since #871) and the
  // kitchen-tools page — about 45 lines each, agreeing on every word by nothing
  // more than having been copied.
  //
  // It is an INPUT, not a confirmation. The commit contract drops "are you
  // sure?", not the chance to say what you want different. That framing is the
  // reason the dialog exists at all, and it is why the title and description are
  // fixed here rather than being props: they are what makes it not a
  // confirmation, and a caller free to reword them could quietly turn it back
  // into one.
  //
  // It lives in components/ rather than @salt/ui-components because it composes
  // Dialog, TextField and Button for one app-specific job — an app composite, not
  // a primitive (Rule 7). Same reasoning as ImagePromptDialog beside it.
