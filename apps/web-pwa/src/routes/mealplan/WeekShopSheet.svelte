  // ─── Shop the week: which nights? (issue #724, Phase 1) ────────────────────
  //
  // The FIRST of the two sheets this flow raises. It picks the recipes; the
  // review — servings, per-ingredient Add/Check, Buy/Make — stays entirely with
  // `RecipeAddToListSheet`, which the page then drives once per pick. Nothing
  // about the shopping list is decided here: this sheet returns a subset of what
  // it was given and forgets it.
  //
  // Meals change what a ROW is and nothing else (#752, Phase 2): a meal speaks
  // for the dishes of its own night, so they fold under it as one line with one
  // tick. What comes back out is still the flat list of entries it was given, in
  // the order the rows offered them — the review queue is untouched.
  //
  // It takes the entries ready-made rather than reaching for the week itself.
  // WHICH week is a fact about where the deck is snapped to, and that belongs to
  // the page (viewport geometry, never a component's business); which recipes may
  // be shopped for is `takesIngredients`, applied there too. So this component is
  // presentation and selection, and both are testable without a deck.

  // One row: a recipe and the night it is planned for. A recipe attached to two
  // nights is two rows, which is why the date is half of a row's identity.

  // What a row actually is once meals are in play (#752, Phase 2): a lead entry,

  // as its components. An ordinary recipe is a group of one, which is why nothing

  //

  //   • never itself → a self-reference is refused at the source, but a row that
