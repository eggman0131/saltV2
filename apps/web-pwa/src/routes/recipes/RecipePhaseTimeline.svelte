  // shipped, and it is the only drawing of `metadata.phases` in the app.

  // THE BAR IS DECORATION AND SAYS SO. It is `aria-hidden`, and every figure in it
  // is repeated in words in the legend beneath: each phase's name, its elapsed
  // time, its hands-on and hands-off split, and whether its wait was drawn
  // shortened. Nothing here depends on colour, on width or on being able to see
  // the strip at all — that is #878's ribbon's contract, met again because the
  // reason for it has not changed.
  //
  // EVERY NUMBER COMES THROUGH THE DOMAIN. `recipePhaseTotals` for the summary
  // line, `phaseElapsedMinutes` (inside `phaseTimelineBlocks`) per phase. This
  // component adds up nothing of its own, so the figure here, the chip on the
  // list and the line on the cook plan cannot disagree.
  //
  // It takes the phase list rather than the `Recipe` so the caller owns the
  // feature gate — the page resolves gate-off to an empty list once, and this
  // component never has to know a gate exists.
