  <!-- The two renders sit hard against each other: whitespace BETWEEN two tags is
       interior and survives Svelte's trim, so a newline here would put a phantom
       leading space into every static chip's `textContent`. Flexbox never paints
       it, but a consumer asserting on the text does see it — the recipe page's
       attribution chip is asserted exactly. The 4px gap comes from
       `.salt-chip--fact`'s `gap-1`, never from a space in the markup. -->
