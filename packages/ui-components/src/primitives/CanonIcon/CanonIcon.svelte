  // Tri-state render boundary. This mirrors @salt/domain's

  // single render boundary. Keep the two in sync if the `"hidden"` sentinel or
  // the rule changes.
  const renderable = $derived(thumbnail !== null && thumbnail !== 'hidden' && thumbnail.length > 0);

  // Display-time cache-bust. A regenerated icon reuses the same (byte-identical)
  // Storage download URL, so the browser serves the stale image; appending a
  // per-regeneration `?v=`/`&v=` nonce forces a re-fetch. Only applied when the
  // icon is renderable (never to `null`/`"hidden"`) and a non-empty `version` is
  // present (an empty version carries no cache-key info); otherwise the raw URL
  // passes through unchanged. Behaviourally identical to @salt/domain's
  // `appendCacheBuster`; the `?`/`&`-aware join is inlined here because
  // ui-components is external-only and cannot import a @salt/domain helper (same
  // reason `isCanonIconRenderable` is duplicated).
  const bustedSrc = $derived(

  // The sage "found its home" tint applies only to a BARE matched tile — a tile
  // that already renders an icon keeps its neutral `bg-icon-tile` backdrop, so
  // matched icons across the app are visually untouched. The first letter fills
  // the otherwise-empty sage square; empty when there is no name.
  //
  // Sage is the "lit up" state the reveal produces, so it is gated with the reveal:
  // under reduced motion the bare matched tile stays grey with no letter — exactly
  // today's appearance — via `motion-reduce:` overrides (the sage colour never
  // animates then either, `transition-colors` being `motion-reduce:transition-none`).
  const sageBare = $derived(matched && !renderable);
  const initial = $derived(name.trim().charAt(0).toUpperCase());

  // ...but a tile that DOES render an icon still lights up for the duration of a
  // reveal. Gating the sage on `!renderable` meant the "it found its home" moment
  // was invisible in its most common form — an item matching an established canon,
  // which by now nearly always has a generated icon — leaving only a sweep over an
  // unchanged tile. `shimmer` is true solely for the reveal window, so this is a
  // transient lift that fades back to `bg-icon-tile` via the tile's
  // `transition-colors` (at `duration-reveal`, the #571 400ms tile crossfade —
  // the pictograms leave their backdrop visible around and through the artwork,
  // so the lift reads behind an icon too); the resting appearance of matched
  // icons across the app is still untouched, which is what the note above is
  // protecting.
  const lit = $derived(sageBare || (matched && shimmer));

  // The tile's backdrop, in one place because four states share it.
  //
  // A tile that RENDERS AN ICON has no backdrop: the pictogram is the object, and
  // the pale grey square behind it (`--salt-icon-tile`, 93% lightness on a 100%
  // white card) only ever diluted it. The tile keeps its box — `size`,
  // `salt-icon-lift`, and the layout slot are unchanged — so nothing about column
  // alignment moves.
  //
  // A BARE tile keeps the grey square. It is a placeholder standing in for art
  // that hasn't generated yet (or that the user hid), and it is what holds the
  // text column straight down a list of part-matched rows; dropping it there
  // would leave the shadow of an empty box and a ragged column.
  //
  // The sage lift is unchanged in both cases (§14.5) — it still reads around and
  // through the artwork. Every arm is a literal string: Tailwind scans source
  // text, so a composed `motion-reduce:${…}` would never be generated. The
  // reduced-motion fallback is each state's own resting backdrop.

    lit
